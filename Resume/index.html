            <!-- THE BIG YAP -->
            <p class="lead">
                Welcome to my portfolio. I am currently a student at the University of the Cordilleras, rigorously pursuing my IT degree with a specialized focus on Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP). To be completely honest, ERP wasn't something I initially chose or even thought about; rather, <strong>ERP was the one that called me.</strong> I pursued this specialization to challenge myself, to expand my horizons on intricate business models, supply chain logistics, and the massive enterprise systems that keep the global economy running.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Growing up, I was never the "tech prodigy" who found passion in raw coding. The rise of AI and automated tools initially killed much of my curiosity, and for a long time, I believed that because coding wasn't my natural forte, I didn't belong in IT. However, I discovered something crucial about myself: <strong>I am a student who delivers results.</strong> I am not a "coder" in the traditional sense; I am a <strong>"Vibecoder."</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                What does that mean? It means that when I find a project that truly matters—whether it's a small automation tool or a complex school activity—I enter a state of hyperfocus. I don't just write syntax; I solve the problem. This shift in perspective is why I am incredibly excited about my upcoming ABAP programming courses. I am hoping to find my footing where logic meets business, eventually securing a career where I can bridge the gap between technical systems and real-world enterprise needs.

            <h3>Personal Profile</h3>
            <p>
                My journey hasn't been a straight line. I took STEM in Senior High at UPang Urdaneta, tried to go for the "big leagues" in Dagupan, and eventually found my home at UC. Despite administrative delays that rendered me an "irregular" student for a year, I have maintained a 100% passing rate. I have fallen into the role of the ERP student, and I am happier here than I would be in any other specialization.

                     <h4>B.S. Information Technology - ERP Specialization</h4>
                     <p>
                         I transferred to the University of the Cordilleras mid-semester, and this is where my ERP specialization officially began. The transition wasn't smooth; due to delays in processing documents from my previous university, I was delayed by a year and spent the majority of my time at UC as an "irregular" student. 
                     </p>
                     <p>
                         This was a challenging period, often feeling like I was playing catch-up. Nonetheless, I never failed a class and eventually regained my footing as a regular student. Looking back, the struggle was worth it. Moving to this university solely for the ERP specialization was the best decision I made for my academic career. I have fully embraced the role of an ERP student.

                         When it was time to enter college, I thought I had to aim for the "big leagues" by enrolling at the main campus in Dagupan. However, they did not offer the ERP specialization. I enrolled in general IT, but I only lasted one semester.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                         It was a pivotal moment of realization. Let us just say that the environment of Dagupan and the culture at UPang Dagupan were not for me. I realized early on that if I was going to succeed, I needed to be in an environment that aligned with my goals and offered the specific specialization I was interested in.

While I wasn't yet focused on Enterprise Systems, the rigorous logic required in STEM prepared me for the complex workflows I now study in ERP.
